## About

killall - kill processes by name

## DESCRIPTION
`killall` sends a signal to all processes running any of the specified commands. If no signal name is specified,
SIGTERM is sent.

Signals can be specified either by name (e.g. -HUP or -SIGHUP) or by number (e.g. -1) or by option -s.

If the command name is not regular expression (option -r) and contains a slash (/), processes executing that partic‚Äê
ular file will be selected for killing, independent of their name.

killall returns a zero return code if at least one process has been killed for each listed command, or no commands
were listed and at least one process matched the -u and -Z search criteria. killall returns non-zero otherwise.

A killall process never kills itself (but may kill other killall processes).
